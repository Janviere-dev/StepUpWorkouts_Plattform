                <h3>Linda's Journey to a Healthier Life</h3>
                <p>Linda was 42, a mother of three, and constantly out of breath—even walking up the stairs felt like climbing a mountain. She wasn’t chasing a six-pack or a marathon medal. She just wanted to breathe again.</p>
                <p>One evening, after struggling to tie her shoes, she opened her browser and typed: “easy exercises for beginners.” That single search changed everything.</p>
                <p>She started with chair squats and wall push-ups—movements she could do in her living room. No gym. No fancy gear. Just determination. Within two weeks, she felt stronger. Within two months, she was walking 30 minutes a day. And within a year, she had lost 60 pounds, lowered her blood pressure, and gained a new sense of joy.</p>
                <p class="linda-quote">“I didn’t wait for motivation. I clicked ‘browse exercises’ and found my future.”</p>
